# PyWang

PyWang installs and imports a random Python library from PyPI via `pip`.

## Benefit

Now you don't have to write your own Python library that imports a random
Python library. I've already done it for you, because I am a kind person who
sympathizes with you, a person who understands the time-consuming
responsibilities required by the Capitalist system.

## Usage

It's real simple. Just `import pywang` then run `pywang.wang()`. You can run
`pywang.wang(quiet=True)` if you want PyWang to shut its stupid mouth.

## A note about formatting

I believe that Markdown is superior to ReStructured Text and do not care that
PyPI only parses ReStructured Text. You will have to deal with it. You are a
smart person. Crack the readme open in your text editor, toss it through a
Markdown renderer, or deal with it. You will have many worse moments before
your continual decay leads to your inevitable final breath and the collection
of atoms called "you" disperse and take their place within other beings.
